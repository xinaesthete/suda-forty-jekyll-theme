The original Clinic building in Kalalasi was not adequate to support the local population in Kalalasi village and the four surrounding villages.

[//]: # image to illustrate the problem. Also, wasn't there something about the government being able to provide staffing, if we built the building?

With the help from the Winchester Catholic Church (Covenant With the Poor) we raised funds and managed to provide a better Clinic building which was later elevated to Health Centre. It now provides care for the sick and runs much needed immunisation programs for the under fives.
