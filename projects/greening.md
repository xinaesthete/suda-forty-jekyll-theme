Kalalasi Village was bare without trees. People had cut trees for cooking fuel.

As a result the villagers faced a huge problem of dust during dry season windy days that caused respiratory diseases. They identified the problem and asked us to help plant trees. We worked in partnership with them to plant trees and encouraged them to preserve the local trees.

Now there is no more dust problem and there are trees everywhere.
