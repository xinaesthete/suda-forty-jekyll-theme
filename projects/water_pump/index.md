Due to effects of climate change the village water well dried up, which meant women and girls who traditionally collect water had to walk long distances in search of water which wasnâ€™t clean and safe.

Sometimes they had to share water with animals. 

As the local economy cannot support construction of significant infrastructure such as this, we fundraised and paid for the water well and pump.
